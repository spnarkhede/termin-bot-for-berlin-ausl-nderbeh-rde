I want you act as a blogger at medium.com and want you write a blog post about a project I have developed.

The project does the followings;
- It automates the process of booking an appointment from Berlin Auslaenderbehorde
- It uses java and selenium framework
- It is open source and available on github
- It doesn't require any notification service or any other service to be running unlike other services
- The biggest advantage of this application is that it actually books the appointment and not just notifies you about the appointment
- It is a dockerized application and can be run on any machine


How I have built the application;

- Before starting the application you need to install docker and docker-compose
- Then you need to run selenium grid on your machine. You can also use your computers browser to run the application but I prefer to use selenium grid because it is more reliable and it is easier to debug the application.
- After running the selenium grid you are ready to develop and test the application

- Go to the main webpage where the application is supposed to start
- Download the html source code of the page and save it as a file in your resources folder 
- Find the elements that you want to interact with
- Get the element id or name or xpath of the elements that you want to interact with
- You can do that by using the developer tools of your browser
- You can also use the selenium framework to get the element id or name or xpath
